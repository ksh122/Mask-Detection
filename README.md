# Real-Time Face Mask Detection App

## Overview

The Real-Time Face Mask Detection App is a computer vision-based application that detects whether a person is wearing a face mask in real-time. 
It utilizes deep learning models trained on a custom dataset and is implemented using OpenCV, YOLO, and TensorFlow.
